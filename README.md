# OpenEMS Energy Scripts

This repository includes multiple scripts to generate energy consumption data for the various machines
used in glass manufacturing. These scripts will then be integrated into an [OpenEMS](https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems)
application to simulate the operating schedule of a glass factory.
