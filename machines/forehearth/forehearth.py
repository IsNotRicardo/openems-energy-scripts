# Disclaimer:
# There are nearly no sources concerning the energy consumption of glass forehearths
# The only source which contains some data is a PDF with some energy consumption values:
# https://glassmanevents.com/content-images/main/2-Electroglass.pdf
# The values also include the pull rate and the temperature drop, which are taken into account
# The formula used below is likely unreliable due to how little data is available

# Unit: Years

# Forehearth aging factor
# The year-on-year energy consumption increase of the forehearth due to aging, wear and other factors
# This value would have to be calculated depending on the specific forehearth system, and how it is used

# Therefore, production values are likely a fraction than those of the furnace

# Production variability throughout the day
# The value is likely similar to that of the furnace, since the forehearth depends on the furnace output
